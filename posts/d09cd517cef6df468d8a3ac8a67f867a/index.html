A computer is a device that takes data as input and does some sort of operations on that data.
There are many examples of what we have called a computer; see figure 1.1 for some examples.

 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Let’s talk a bit about what actually makes up a quantum computer. To facilitate this discussion, let’s briefly talk about what the term <em>computer</em> means.</span></span></p>

</div> 
<div id="29"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">All of these have in common that we can model them with classical physics—that is, in terms of Newton’s laws of motion, Newtonian gravity, and electromagnetism. This will help us tell apart the kinds of computers we’re used to (e.g., laptops, phones, bread machines, houses, cars, and pacemakers) and the computers we’re learning about in this book. To tell the two apart, we’ll call computers that can be described using classical physics <em>classical computers</em>. What’s nice about this is that if we replace the term <em>classical physics</em> with <em>quantum physics</em>, we have a great definition for what a quantum computer is!</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <div id="30"> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#e8e8e8;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><strong><span style="color:inherit;">DEFINITION</span></strong></span></span></p> 
 </div> 
 <div id="31"> 
  <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="background-color:#e8e8e8;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;">A <em>quantum computer</em> is a device that takes data as input and does some sort of operations on that data with a process that can only be described using quantum physics.</span></span></p> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<div id="32"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Put differently, the distinction between classical and quantum computers is precisely that between classical and quantum physics. We will get into this more later in the book. But the primary difference is one of scale: our everyday experience is largely with objects that are large enough and hot enough that even though quantum effects still exist, they don’t do much on average. While quantum mechanics works even at the scale of everyday objects like coffee mugs, bags of flour, and baseball bats, it turns out that we can do a very good job of describing how these objects interact using classical physics alone.</span></span></p>

  <p><span style="background-color:#e8e8e8;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><strong><span style="color:inherit;">DEEP DIVE: WHAT HAPPENED TO RELATIVITY?</span></strong></span></span></p> 
 </div> 
 <div id="34"> 
  <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="background-color:#e8e8e8;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;">Quantum physics applies to objects that are very small and very cold or well isolated. Similarly, another branch of physics called <em>relativity</em> describes objects that are large enough for gravity to play an important role or that are moving very fast—near the speed of light. Many computers rely on relativistic effects; indeed, global positioning satellites depend critically on relativity. So far, we have primarily been comparing classical and quantum physics, so what about relativity?</span></span></p> 
 </div> 
 <div id="35"> 
  <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="background-color:#e8e8e8;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;">As it turns out, all computation that is implemented using relativistic effects can also be described using purely classical models of computing such as Turing machines. By contrast, quantum computation cannot be described as faster classical computation but requires a different mathematical model. There has not yet been a proposal for a “gravitic computer” that uses relativity in the same way, so we’re safe to set relativity aside in this book.</span></span></p> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<div id="36"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">If we focus on a much smaller scale where quantum mechanics <em>is</em> needed to describe our systems, then quantum computing is the art of using small, well-isolated devices to usefully transform data in ways that cannot be described in terms of classical physics alone. One way to build quantum devices is to use small classical computers such as digital signal processors (DSPs) to control the properties of exotic materials.</span></span></p>

 </div> 
 <div id="38"> 
  <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">The exotic materials used to build quantum computers have names that can sound intimidating, like <em>superconductors</em> and <em>topological insulators</em>. We can take solace, though, from how we learn to understand and use classical computers.</span></span></p> 
 </div> 
 <div id="39"> 
  <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">We can program classical computers without knowing what a semiconductor is. Similarly, the physics behind how we build quantum computers is a fascinating subject, but it’s not required for us to learn how to program and use quantum devices.</span></span></p> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<div id="40"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Quantum devices may differ in the details of how they are controlled, but ultimately all quantum devices are controlled from and read out by classical computers and control electronics of some kind. After all, we are interested in classical data, so there must eventually be an interface with the classical world.</span></span></p>

 <div id="42"> 
  <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="background-color:#e8e8e8;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;">Most quantum devices must be kept very cold and well isolated, since they can be extremely susceptible to noise.</span></span></p>

</div> 
<div id="43"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">By applying quantum operations using embedded classical hardware, we can manipulate and transform quantum data. The power of quantum computing then comes from carefully choosing which operations to apply in order to implement a useful transformation that solves a problem of interest.</span></span></p>

<div id="46"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">It is important to understand both the potential and the limitations of quantum computers, especially given the hype surrounding quantum computation. Many of the misunderstandings underlying this hype stem from extrapolating analogies beyond where they make any sense—all analogies have their limits, and quantum computing is no different. Simulating how a quantum program acts in practice can be a great way to help test and refine the understanding provided by analogies. Nonetheless, we will still use analogies in this book, as they can help provide intuition for how quantum computation works.</span></span></p> 
</div>

 <div id="47"> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#e8e8e8;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><strong><span style="color:inherit;">TIP</span></strong></span></span></p> 
 </div> 
 <div id="48"> 
  <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="background-color:#e8e8e8;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;">If you’ve ever seen descriptions of new results in quantum computing that read like “We can teleport cats that are in two places at once using the power of infinitely many parallel universes all working together to cure cancer,” then you’ve seen the danger of extrapolating too far from where analogies are useful.</span></span></p> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<div id="49"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">One especially common point of confusion regarding quantum computing is how users will use quantum computers. As a society, we’ve come to understand what a <em>computer</em> is: something you can use to run web applications, write documents, and run simulations. In fact, classical computers do so many different things in our life that we don’t always even notice what is and isn’t a computer. Cory Doctorow made this observation by noting that “Your car is a computer you sit inside of” (DrupalCon Amsterdam 2014 keynote, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaf3Sl2r3jE" rel="nofollow" title="www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaf3Sl2r3jE">www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaf3Sl2r3jE</a>).</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="50"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Quantum computers, however, are likely to be much more special-purpose—we expect quantum computers to be pointless for some tasks. A great model for how quantum computing will fit into our existing classical computing stack is GPUs. GPUs are specialized hardware devices designed to speed up particular types of calculations like graphics drawing, machine learning tasks, and anything easily parallelizable. You want a GPU for those specific tasks but likely do not want to use it for everything, as we have much more flexible CPUs for general tasks like checking email. Quantum computers will be exactly the same: they will be good at accelerating specific types of tasks but will not be appropriate for broad use.</span></span></p>

 </div> 
 <div id="52"> 
  <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="background-color:#e8e8e8;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;">Programming a quantum computer comes with some restrictions, so classical computers will be preferable when there’s no particular quantum advantage to be found.</span></span></p> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<div id="53"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Classical computing will still be around and will be the primary way we communicate and interact with each other, as well as our quantum hardware. Even to get the classical computing resource to interface with the quantum devices, in most cases, we will also need a digital-to-analog signal processor, as shown in figure 1.3.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="54" style="text-align:center;"> 
 <p><span style="background-color:#FFFFFF;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><strong><span style="color:inherit;">Figure 1.3 An example of how a quantum device might interact with a classical computer through the use of a digital signal processor (DSP). The DSP sends low-power signals into the quantum device and amplifies very low-power signals coming back to the device.</span></strong></span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="55"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Moreover, quantum physics describes things at very small scales (both size and energy) that are well isolated from their surroundings. This puts some hard limitations on the environments in which we can run a quantum computer. One possible solution is to keep quantum devices in cryogenic fridges, often near absolute 0 K (–459.67°F, or –273.15°C). While this is not a problem in a data center, maintaining a dilution refrigerator isn’t really something that makes sense on a desktop, much less on a laptop or a cell phone. For this reason, quantum computers will likely be used through the cloud, at least for quite a while after they first become commercially available.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="56"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Using quantum computers as a cloud service resembles other advances in specialized computing hardware. By centralizing exotic computing resources like the following in data centers, it’s possible to explore computing models that are difficult for all but the largest users to deploy on-premises:</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<ul><li id="57">Specialized gaming hardware (PlayStation Now, Xbox One)</li><li id="58">Extremely low-latency, high-performance computing (e.g., Infiniband) clusters for scientific problems</li><li id="59">Massive GPU clusters</li><li id="60">Reprogrammable hardware (e.g., Catapult/Brainwave)</li><li id="61">Tensor processing unit (TPU) clusters</li><li id="62">High-permanence, high-latency archival storage (e.g., Amazon Glacier)</li></ul> 
<div id="63"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Going forward, cloud services like Azure Quantum (<a href="https://azure.com/quantum" rel="nofollow" title="Microsoft Quantum overview | Microsoft Azure">Microsoft Quantum overview | Microsoft Azure</a>) will make the power of quantum computing available in much the same way.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="64"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Just as high-speed, high-availability internet connections have made cloud computing accessible for large numbers of users, we will be able to use quantum computers from the comfort of our favorite WiFi-blanketed beach or coffee shop or even from a train as we view majestic mountain ranges in the distance.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="65"> 
 <h4 id="heading_id_6" style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;"><strong><span style="color:inherit;">1.3.1 What can quantum computers do?</span></strong></span></span></h4> 
</div> 
<div id="66"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">As quantum programmers, if we have a particular problem, <em>how do we know it makes sense to solve it with a quantum computer</em>?</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="67"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">We are still learning about the exact extent of what quantum computers are capable of, and thus we don’t have any concrete rules to answer this question yet. So far, we have found some examples of problems where quantum computers offer significant advantages over the best-known classical approaches. In each case, the quantum algorithms that have been found to solve these problems exploit quantum effects to achieve the advantages, sometimes referred to as a <em>quantum advantage</em>. The following are two useful quantum algorithms:</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<ul><li id="68">Grover’s algorithm (discussed in chapter 11) searches a list of <em>N</em> items in √<em>N</em> steps.</li><li id="69">Shor’s algorithm (chapter 12) quickly factors large integers, such as those used by cryptography to protect private data.</li></ul> 
<div id="70"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">We’ll see several more in this book, but Grover’s and Shor’s are good examples of how quantum algorithms work: each uses quantum effects to separate correct answers to computational problems from invalid solutions. One way to realize a quantum advantage is to find ways of using quantum effects to separate correct and incorrect solutions to classical problems.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <div id="71"> 
  <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">What are quantum advantages?</span></span></p> 
 </div> 
 <div id="72"> 
  <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Grover’s and Shor’s algorithms illustrate two distinct kinds of quantum advantages. Factoring integers might be easier classically than we suspect. Many people have tried very hard to factor integers quickly and haven’t succeeded, but that doesn’t mean we can <em>prove</em> that factoring is difficult. On the other hand, we can prove that Grover’s algorithm is faster than <em>any</em> classical algorithm; the catch is that it uses a different kind of input.</span></span></p> 
 </div> 
 <div id="73"> 
  <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Finding a <em>provable</em> advantage for a practical problem is an active area of research in quantum computing. That said, quantum computers can be powerful tools for solvingproblems, even if we can’t prove that there will never be a better classical algorithm. After all, Shor’s algorithm challenges the assumptions underlying large swaths of information security—a mathematical proof is necessary only because we haven’t yet built a quantum computer large enough to run Shor’s algorithm.</span></span></p> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<div id="74"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Quantum computers also offer significant benefits for simulating properties of quantum systems, opening up applications to quantum chemistry and materials science. For instance, quantum computers could make it much easier to learn about the ground-state energies of chemical systems. These ground-state energies then provide insight into reaction rates, electronic configurations, thermodynamic properties, and other properties of immense interest in chemistry.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="75"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Along the way to developing these applications, we have also seen significant advantages in spin-off technologies such as quantum key distribution and quantum metrology, some of which we will see in the next few chapters. In learning to control and understand quantum devices for the purpose of computing, we have also learned valuable techniques for imaging, parameter estimation, security, and more. While these are not applications for quantum computing in a strict sense, they go a long way toward showing the values of <em>thinking</em> in terms of quantum computation.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="76"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Of course, new applications of quantum computers are much easier to discover when we have a concrete understanding of how quantum algorithms work and how to build new algorithms from basic principles. From that perspective, quantum programming is a great resource to learn how to discover entirely new applications.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="77"> 
 <h4 id="heading_id_7" style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;"><strong><span style="color:inherit;">1.3.2 What can’t quantum computers do?</span></strong></span></span></h4> 
</div> 
<div id="78"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Like other forms of specialized computing hardware, quantum computers won’t be good at everything. For some problems, classical computers will simply be better suited to the task. In developing applications for quantum devices, it’s helpful to note what tasks or problems are out of scope for quantum computing.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="79"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">The short version is that we don’t have any hard-and-fast rules to quickly decide which tasks are best run on classical computers and which tasks can take advantage of quantum computers. For example, the storage and bandwidth requirements for Big Data–style applications are very difficult to map onto quantum devices, where we may only have a relatively small quantum system. Current quantum computers can only record inputs of no more than a few dozen bits, and this limitation will become more relevant as quantum devices are used for more demanding tasks. Although we expect to eventually build much larger quantum systems than we can now, classical computers will likely always be preferable for problems that require large amounts of input/output to solve.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="80"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">Similarly, machine learning applications that depend heavily on random access to large sets of classical inputs are conceptually difficult to solve with quantum computing. That said, there <em>may</em> be other machine learning applications that map much more naturally onto quantum computation. Research efforts to find the best ways to apply quantum resources to solve machine learning tasks are still ongoing. In general, problems that have small input and output data sizes but require large amounts of computation to get from input to output are good candidates for quantum computers.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div id="81"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">In light of these challenges, it might be tempting to conclude that quantum computers <em>always</em> excel at tasks that have small inputs and outputs but very intense computation between the two. Notions like <em>quantum parallelism</em> are popular in media, and quantum computers are sometimes even described as using parallel universes to compute.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <div id="82"> 
  <p><span style="background-color:#e8e8e8;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><strong><span style="color:inherit;">NOTE</span></strong></span></span></p> 
 </div> 
 <div id="83"> 
  <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="background-color:#e8e8e8;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;">The concept of “parallel universes” is a great example of an analogy that can help make quantum concepts understandable but can lead to nonsense when taken to its extreme. It can sometimes be helpful to think of the different parts of a quantum computation as being in different universes that can’t affect each other, but this description makes it harder to think about some of the effects we will learn in this book, such as interference. When taken too far, the parallel-universes analogy also lends itself to thinking of quantum computing in ways that are closer to a particularly pulpy and fun episode of a sci-fi show like <em>Star Trek</em> than to reality.</span></span></p> 
 </div> 
</div> 
<div id="84"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">What this fails to communicate, however, is that it isn’t always obvious how to use quantum effects to extract useful answers from a quantum device, even if the state of the quantum device appears to contain the desired output. For instance, one way to factor an integer <em>N</em> using a classical computer is to list each <em>potential</em> factor and check whether it’s actually a factor or not:</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<ol><li id="85">Let <em>i</em> = 2.</li><li id="86">Check if the remainder of <em>N / i</em> is zero. 
  <ul><li>If so, return that <em>i</em> factors <em>N</em>.</li><li>If not, increment <em>i</em> and loop.</li></ul></li></ol> 
<div id="87"> 
 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">We can speed up this classical algorithm by using a large number of different classical computers, one for each potential factor that we want to try. That is, this problem can be easily parallelized. A quantum computer can try each potential factor within the same device, but as it turns out, this isn’t <em>yet</em> enough to factor integers faster than the classical approach. If we use this approach on a quantum computer, the output will be one of the potential factors chosen at random. The actual correct factors will occur with probability about <em>1/√<em>N</em></em>, which is no better than the classical algorithm.</span></span></p>

 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">As we’ll see in chapter 12, though, we can use other quantum effects to factor integers with a quantum computer faster than the best-known classical factoring algorithms. Much of the heavy lifting done by Shor’s algorithm is to make sure that the probability of measuring a correct factor at the end is much larger than the probability of measuring an incorrect factor. Canceling out incorrect answers this way is where much of the art of quantum programming comes in; it’s not easy or even possible to do for all problems we might want to solve.</span></span></p>

 <p style="margin-left:0;"><span style="color:#3c3c3c;"><span style="background-color:#ffffff;">To understand more concretely what quantum computers can and can’t do and how to do cool things with quantum computers despite these challenges, it’s helpful to take a more concrete approach. Thus, let’s consider what a quantum program even <strong>is</strong>, so that we can start writing our own.</span></span></p>
